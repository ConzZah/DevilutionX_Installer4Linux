# DevilutionX_Installer4Linux

The script will download the latest release of DevilutionX based on your systems architecture.

if on Debian or any rpm based distro it will also install the deb / rpm package respectively

if on Alpine it will ask you if you want to install the flatpak version or build from source


Cheers, ConzZah
